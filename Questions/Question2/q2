No, it is not mandatory however typing git status will show you the missing steps 
youll need in order to properly upload your git repository.

ls, git status, and pwd are all bash terminal commands and not part of node. typing 
in node in the terminal opens up the Node REPL and you need programming language
in order for commands to work.

you may type .help while in Node REPL to go back to regular terminal.
