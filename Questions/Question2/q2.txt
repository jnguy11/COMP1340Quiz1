The git status command is not mandatory to type each time you run commands in git. It only serves as a way to tell if you need the necessary step[s in order to upload your git repository onto github and to help you with knowing wether the files in the folder are correctly updated and ready to be uploaded onto git hubThe commands ls git status and pwd fail because when yo0u type node in terminal, it opens up the Node REPL which will accept javascript languages and not the 3 commands are not part of the node language, they are used in bash in the terminal. You may type .help while in the Node REPL
